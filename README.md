# Rego Policies

This repository contains rego policies for use with [the Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/). The goal is to create a set of policies, upload them to an OCI registry and pull them as part of a CI/CD pipeline using [conftest](https://github.com/instrumenta/conftest)
